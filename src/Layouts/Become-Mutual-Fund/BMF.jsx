                  The major motive of this examination is to ensure that the distributor has fundamental knowledge regarding Mutual Funds. Passing a certificate issued by National Institute of Securities Market (NISM) in respect of ‘NISM – Series V-A  has a validity period of three years.

                     Once the NISM exam is cleared, the AMFI Registration Number (ARN) gets allotted. It is a unique code, or we can say a unique ID of every mutual fund distributor. Along with the ARN Number, candidates will also get an Employee Unique Identity Number (EUIN). The process of getting ARN is completely online and the same can be accessed here.<br/><br/>
                     A photo identity card bearing a unique ARN, address, his/ her name, photo and the validity period of ARN, would be issued to individual applicants.
