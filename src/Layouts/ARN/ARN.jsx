To become an ARN Holder, it is necessary to qualify for the NISM Series V-A: Mutual Fund Distributors Certification Examination.<br/><br/>

                                              No distributor shall hold more than one ARN card/ Letter of Registration. The certificate comes with a validity period of 3 years. Once the validity period is over, the distributor needs to apply for ARN renewal online. The renewal also depends upon two factors that:<br/><br/>

Mutual fund distributors are expected to help the customers manage the risk with their knowledge.<br/>

                                                                       The intermediary, or we can say the mutual fund agent, educates and informs the investor about all the risks involved and how they can manage the risk by choosing the right schemes. <br/>
